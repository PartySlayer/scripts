# scripts
Bash scripts written by me, simulating realistic tasks in a devops job.

The first script filter out the output from ps to find zombie processes and kill it.

The second script writes in a file the 10 biggest files in the filesystem or the path specified as an argument.

The third script asks for remote origin and first commit comment to easily start a github repository.
